My solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenge.

## What is Advent of Code?

[Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com) is an online event created by [Eric Wastl](https://twitter.com/ericwastl). Each year, starting on Dec 1st, an advent calendar of small programming puzzles are unlocked once a day at midnight (EST/UTC-5). Developers of all skill sets are encouraged to solve them in any programming language they choose!

## 2021 Progress

This is will use Advent of Code to develop my Python skils, and try to solve all puzzels using Python!
